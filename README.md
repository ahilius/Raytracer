# Raytracer

A WebGL2 based realtime raytracer created to see if a fragment shader could read a mesh and kd-tree from a texture.

A ```R32UI``` texture (1 unsigned integer per texel) was used, I also tried a ```RGBA32UI``` texture (4 unsigned integers per texel), expecting to see a speed increase due to less texture reads, but it ended up a little slower.

The texture is generated by a Blender mesh exporter plugin, which outputs a LZMA compressed binary file.

You can try the [raytracer here](http://andrewhills.github.io/raytracer/demo.html). The controls are just a left click to look around.
