I = E × (D / (D + L × r))
I = E × (D / (D + L × r)) × (D^2 / (D^2 + Q × r^2))
Where
I is the calculated Intensity of light.
E is the current Energy slider setting.
D is the current setting of the Dist field.
L is the current setting of the Linear slider.
Q is the current setting of the Quad slider.
r is the distance from the lamp where the light intensity gets measured.

Inverse Square: Linear to 0.0 and Quad to 1.0),

Inverse Linear: Linear to 1.0 and Quad to 0.0.
